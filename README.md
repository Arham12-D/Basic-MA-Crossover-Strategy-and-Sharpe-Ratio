# Basic-MA-Crossover-Strategy-and-Sharpe-Ratio
This is a small project I built to understand how trading strategies should actually be backtested, rather than to chase performance.

The strategy itself is a simple 20–50 day moving average crossover, but the focus of the project is on getting the mechanics right.

What’s inside:-

* Historical price data pulled using yfinance

* Buy and sell signals based on MA crossovers

* Clear separation between signals and positions

* Proper handling of look-ahead bias

* Strategy vs buy-and-hold comparison

* Cumulative returns and Sharpe ratio

* A basic plot to visualize performance
